The first step to working with the Rhino Editor is installing it!

```js
npm install rhino-editor
```

After installing, we can import it in our project.

```js
// index.js
import "rhino-editor"
import "rhino-editor/exports/styles/trix.css"
```

The above will auto-register the `<rhino-editor>` element for you.
For more ways to initialize the editor, checkout the [Setup](/tutorials/setup) page.

Finally, to see it appear on a page you can write the following HTML:

```html
<rhino-editor></rhino-editor>
```

And you're on your way! But you're not done yet!

Head on over to [Setup](/tutorials/setup) for a more in-depth explanation of setting up the editor!
